  <h2 id="what">What Ninai is (and is not)</h2>
  <p><strong>Ninai is a platform for building agentic workflows around real systems of record.</strong> It helps you reliably turn natural-language intent into structured operations, while keeping strong safety boundaries around side effects.</p>

  <p>Ninai is also a <em>memory OS</em>: it provides a consistent way to store, classify, retrieve, and govern knowledge and artifacts so agents and humans can collaborate using shared context.</p>

  <div class="callout note">
    <div class="title">What Ninai is not</div>
    <ul>
      <li>Not a single model prompt that you ship and forget.</li>
      <li>Not a replacement for your databases, ticketing tools, or operational processes.</li>
      <li>Not safe by default unless you keep side effects behind tools and policy.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2 id="primitives">The core primitives</h2>
  <p>Ninai systems are easier to build when you separate responsibilities into primitives. These primitives compose into agents, pipelines, and products.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Goals</strong>: structured intent and progress (graph of nodes, dependencies, evidence).</li>
    <li><strong>Memory</strong>: durable context with lifecycle controls (TTL, promotion, classification).</li>
    <li><strong>Tools</strong>: connectors to the outside world (APIs, databases, ticket systems) with schemas and timeouts.</li>
    <li><strong>Policy</strong>: deterministic allow/deny/approve gates; the source of truth for safety and compliance.</li>
    <li><strong>Supervision</strong>: risk-based review, escalations, and approvals (human-in-the-loop when needed).</li>
  </ul>

  </figure>

  <h2 id="loops">The two loops: execution and learning</h2>
  <p>Most teams focus on execution (make the agent do the task). Production teams also invest in learning (make the system improve safely over time).</p>
  <h3>Execution loop</h3>
  <p>The execution loop is the path from a request to an outcome: planning, tool calls, evidence capture, and goal state transitions. The key property is replayability: you can reconstruct what happened from event logs and artifacts.</p>
  <h3>Learning loop</h3>
  <p>The learning loop is how you raise quality without increasing risk. You measure failures, adjust policies and prompts, add tests, and promote validated knowledge to long-term memory after review.</p>

  <div class="callout tip">
    <div class="title">Practical rule</div>
    <p>If you cannot explain <em>why</em> a decision was made using stored evidence, you are not ready to automate high-impact actions.</p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="trust">Trust model: fail-closed by design</h2>
  <p>Ninai is designed for environments where being wrong is expensive. “Fail-closed” means the system should stop, ask for approval, or degrade to read-only behavior when it is uncertain or when the risk is high.</p>
  <h3>Why fail-closed matters</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Safety</strong>: prevents an agent from taking irreversible actions during ambiguity.</li>
    <li><strong>Compliance</strong>: ensures policies are enforced deterministically.</li>
    <li><strong>Debuggability</strong>: you can see where the system refused to proceed and why.</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The model is not the system of record. Your data plane and policy engine are.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2 id="tenancy">Tenancy and governance</h2>
  <p>Ninai is commonly deployed in multi-tenant environments. Tenant isolation must be enforced everywhere: request authentication, database access, memory retrieval, and audit records.</p>

  <div class="callout warn">
    <div class="title">Never rely on application code alone for isolation</div>
    <p>Use database-enforced isolation (for example, row-level security) so cross-tenant reads are impossible even when a bug slips into the application layer.</p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="first-project">Your first practical project</h2>
  <p>Start with something useful, but low risk. A good first project is a <strong>read-only knowledge assistant</strong>:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Store team knowledge as memories with tags, entities, and classifications.</li>
    <li>Implement semantic search to retrieve relevant memories.</li>
    <li>Return an evidence-based answer and link the sources.</li>
    <li>Add a feedback loop: thumbs-up/down and “this was outdated”.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This project naturally evolves into customer support, AIOps incident search, or internal policy search—without requiring any write actions or automation approvals on day one.</p>

  <h2 id="pitfalls">Common pitfalls</h2>
  <h3>Pitfall 1: Putting long work in HTTP requests</h3>
  <p>Agent workflows can take seconds to minutes due to tool latency. Use background workers and run IDs, not a single request that blocks.</p>

  <h3>Pitfall 2: Treating memory as a dumping ground</h3>
  <p>Without TTL, classification, and promotion rules, memory becomes a liability. Prefer fewer, higher-quality memories with consistent tagging.</p>

  <h3>Pitfall 3: Over-automating too early</h3>
  <p>Start read-only, then add write tools behind approvals, then gradually allow limited automation where the risk is understood and the rollback path is clear.</p>
